    <div class="MidImageText" href="#">
        Young people with a brain injury tend to get tired more quickly, have difficulty with short-term memory and find
        it difficult to concentrate. However, they often do not lose their intelligence but rather they lose their
        ability to communicate and function physically.
        <br><br>
        Examples of acquired brain injuries include Multiple Sclerosis, brain tumours, strokes, traumatic brain injuries
        caused by an accident or fall or other degenerative neurological diseases.
