                Our outdoor recumbent cycling program has repeatedly shown significant benefits to people living with a brain injury. The problem however is a cycle centre may not always be easily accessible. By developing the stationary home-based recumbent cycle (VRcycle) we can now bring the benefits of the outdoor cycling into the homes of people with a severe brain injury.
