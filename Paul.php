                <div class="section-text">
                    Barker old boy, Paul Isaacs was 22 when he suffered a fractured
                    skull as a result of a car accident while on a skiing holiday
                    in New Zealand. On a day of extreme winds, Paul was the passenger
                    in a car that veered onto the gravel shoulder where upon the car
                    skidded and overturned. Eventually arriving at hospital 8 hours later
                    Paul was operated on for his head injuries.
                    <br><br>
                    In the weeks following the accident the shock to his head caused
                    a build up of pressure on the brain that made breathing very difficult.
                    After passing this initial hurdle Paul was transferred back to Australia
                    where he spent the next four months in Royal North Shore Hospital
                    in-and-out of intensive care. Then onto the Ryde Royal Rehabilitation
                    Centre to begin his rehabilitation.
                    <br><br>
                    More than 12 months after the accident he returned home to Lindfield.
                    A marvellous team of volunteers were then assembled who worked tirelessly
                    with Paul to help at his home over the next 4 years. Primarily however he
                    was looked after by his parents, Lyn and Kev, for the next 10 years until
                    the physical demands of continual and ongoing care became too much.
                    <br><br>
                    Lyn and Kev were faced with the problem that there were no facilities in
                    Sydney that could accommodate a young person requiring 24 hour care. As
                    a compromise in 2002 Paul took up residence at Wescott Aged Care Facility
                    in Stockton (near Newcastle).
                    <br><br>
                    It took another 10 years of living in an aged care facility before an
                    opportunity arose in 2012 (through the Young People in Residential Aged Care program)
                    to live in the age appropriate residential care facility called Weemala. Weemala had
                    just been constructed on the Ryde Rehabilitation Centre site and is a wonderful
                    facility that offers accommodation and rehabilitation facilities for young people.
                    <br><br>
                    From the time Paul started living at “Weemala” his physical and mental
                    improvement has been considerable. He is still wheelchair bound but has
                    a goal to walk which is keenly supported by the on-site rehab team.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>We want to thank Freshtrack so very much for their support </b> in providing
                    $2000 to buy the GRAFO carbon fibre ankle and foot brace. This foot brace
                    now makes Paul’s dream of walking again a real possibility.
                    <br><br>
                    So many years after the accident Paul now considers he is really “home”.
                    At Weemala he is so happy to be close to his parents, sister, other family
                    and friends who visit him regularly. From Paul’s point of view “all’s good”.
