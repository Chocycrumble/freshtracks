                        People with an acquired brain injury may have difficulty controlling, coordinating and communicating their

                        Young people with a brain injury tend to get tired more quickly, have difficulty with short-term memory
                        and find
                        it difficult to concentrate. However, they often do not lose their intelligence but rather they lose their
                        ability to communicate and function physically.
                        <br><br>
                        Examples of acquired brain injuries include Multiple Sclerosis, brain tumours, strokes, traumatic brain
                        injuries
                        caused by an accident or fall or other degenerative neurological diseases.

                        Rehabilitation is vital for a personâ€™s recovery and generally includes physiotherapy, occupational therapy
                        and speech therapy to help them relearn lost skills. The rate of improvement varies from person to person
                        with the fastest improvement in the first six months.
